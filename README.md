# Hi, I’m Clare Jordan  

Clinical program consultant focused on mental health parity, clinical quality, and practical AI automation. I build simple tools that help clinicians do great work with less friction.

**What I do**
- Parity and NQTL analysis that turns policy into clear action
- Clinical risk support programs that help providers manage high risk cases safely
- SOAP note quality evaluation and coaching
- Python automation for Word and Excel templates in real workflows
- Privacy‑first de‑identification and redaction
- Patient‑to‑provider matching experiments for access and fit
  
**Featured projects**
> I am building these in public. Links will update as repos go live.
- **clinical-risk-consults-playbook** — decision flows, consult templates, and a tiny demo app for high risk support  
- **parity-nqtl-analyzer** — extract and flag non‑quantitative treatment limits from synthetic plan docs  
- **soap-note-evals** — a rubric and small evaluator for diagnosis alignment, MSE detail, risk documentation, and plan quality  
- **doc-automation-with-python** — generate Word docs from JSON, clean provider rosters, and prep reports with one command  
- **redaction-and-deidentification** — regex and NLP pipelines that remove names, addresses, and other identifiers with metrics  
- **clinical-triage-matching-sim** — rules and simple models to match patients to the right providers with a small dashboard
  
**Skills**

Python, pandas, numpy, openpyxl, python-docx, spaCy, regex, Streamlit, Jupyter, GitHub Actions, Power Automate, Smartsheet, MHPAEA parity, ASAM, LOCUS, InterQual, clinical operations, quality improvement

**How I work**
- No PHI. All examples use synthetic data.  
- Safety and privacy notes appear in every repo.  
- Readmes include limitations and when to involve a human reviewer.
  
**Now**
- Shipping v1 of the risk playbook and parity analyzer  
- Drafting the SOAP note evaluator and doc automation scripts  
- Posting short build notes in each repo’s Issues tab
